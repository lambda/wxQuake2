A very incomplete library for parsing BSP files.  This library has never
actually been run; several important stub functions are unimplemented.

However, this library is useful because it contains extensive doxygen
comments describing many otherwise undocumented aspects of bsp files.

If we ever start working on AI again, this library will help us get
started.
