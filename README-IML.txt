IML COMPILATION NOTES FOR QUAKE2
--------------------------------

To build Quake2, you'll need to install Microsoft Visual C++ version
6.0 from a properly-licensed MSDN CD.  Once that is done, you'll need
to install MASM (the Microsoft macro assembler) and copy two files
into your VC98/Bin directory:

  ML.EXE
  ML.ERR

Note that this code is under the GPL, so DON'T LINK IT AGAINST ANY OF
OUR CODE WITHOUT OFFICIAL PERMISSION FROM JOE AND/OR DARTMOUTH LEGAL.

For now, I'll be doing most of my work on various CVS branches, not on
CVS HEAD.  So check out the available branch tags if you want to find
something interesting.
